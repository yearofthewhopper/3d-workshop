* change direction
* turrets that can be aimed
* projectile emitting
* simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
* add basic lighting
* projectile disappears
* camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
* explosions deform the landscape
* player motion follows the landscape
* cooler player geometry
* fix height interpolation on tank motion
* improve crater formation
* health bar floats above player
* water!
* particles for motion, smoke, fire
* reduce terrain update area
* Add Radar (and place for other HUD to live)
* random color for each player
* name for player!  (color + animal)

## GAMEPLAY STUFF ##

variable firing distance
angle of tank should contribute to firing angle
show player names
score for kills, accuracy
respawn upon empty health

destructible objects (trees, houses, etc)


## TERRAIN STUFF ##

!!! create lookup function to get surface normal for any terrain coordinate

multiple landscapes (terrain shader)
crater texture (charred mesh!)
world boundaries (define the landscape)

sound!
projectile force
cool down period for firing
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
shared physics engine
time bomb (alters running time for other players)
