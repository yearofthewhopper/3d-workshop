* change direction
* turrets that can be aimed
* projectile emitting
* simulate wind that alters projectile trajectory
* add basic lighting
* projectile disappears
* camera follows the player (camera modes: world and player)
* explosions deform the landscape
* player motion follows the landscape
* cooler player geometry
* fix height interpolation on tank motion
* improve crater formation
* health bar floats above player
* water!
* particles for motion, smoke, fire
* reduce terrain update area
* Add Radar (and place for other HUD to live)
* random color for each player
* name for player!  (color + animal)
* multiple landscapes (terrain shader)
* respawn upon empty health
* score for kills
* variable firing distance
* create lookup function to get surface normal for any terrain coordinate
* random spawn locations
* projectile force
* set the HUD to ignore depth buffer
* angle of tank should contribute to firing angle
* sound!
* Time of day effects sky color
* Sky illuminates shadows at dusk/dawn (also, see sky shader technique - http://csc.lsu.edu/~kooima/misc/cs594/final/part2.html)
* world boundaries (define the landscape)


## GAMEPLAY STUFF ##

show player names
score for accuracy
destructible objects (trees, houses, etc)
cool down period for firing
obstacles (trees, rocks): eventually randomized
shared physics engine
time bomb (alters running time for other players)


## TERRAIN STUFF ##

Decals on terrain (blast marks, tread track marks)
Lighting effects on terrain (explosions)
crater texture (charred mesh!)


## Time of day stuff ##

Add lighting to water shader
